# Settings

Portable settings are stored in plugin `data.json`. The Python executable is machine-local and stored in `%LOCALAPPDATA%/ObsidianVaultSearch/vaults/<vault-id>/machine.json`.

- Search top-k, RRF, `maxChunksPerFile`, `titleRrfWeight`, and `prefixFallback` changes are hot-applied.
- `maxChunksPerFile` defaults to 1 to maximize distinct-file coverage for agent retrieval.
- `titleRrfWeight` is the independent title retrieval channel weight; 0 disables the channel so only body/vector candidates remain.
- `prefixFallback` retries FTS5 with token prefixes only when exact BM25 returns no results.
- Include/exclude changes are hot-applied and reconciled.
- Model, device, prefixes, and normalization trigger an atomic vector rebuild.
- `chunkingStrategy` defaults to `paragraph-v1`, which preserves the original paragraph chunker.
- `markdown-v2` keeps Markdown headings as embedding breadcrumbs and groups fences, tables, lists, and callouts at atom boundaries.
- Changing the chunking strategy, chunk size, or overlap triggers an atomic complete rebuild.
- Failed rebuilds restore the previous settings and index.

Paths are vault-relative POSIX-style globs. Absolute paths and traversal are rejected by the backend.
